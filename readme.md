# Week #09

## Case Study #02 - Code Debugging & Hosting

### Part #1 Essential

1. You can find me if you look at the starting point. - app.js

2. I am a third-party module that is installed and has an important role. I will prevent your application from running. The entire part of myself is missing. - imported module body-parser

3. I am a local (user-defined) module. I am checking whether you can distinguish the location name from my name. - Renamed file name homerouter.js -> homeroute.js

4. I appear as a module. I am just an array of Objects. Someone didn't call my name properly. - var users -> var user

5. I will be a sick joke when you run this application.

### Part #2 Improvisation and Updating

6. Change me, first navbar will tell. I am an array of objects which can be modularised and kept somewhere as static data. - Moved navs array to a seperate module in data/navs.js

7. I took care when someone else tries to access this server for resource sharing. I am not currently used. Add me if you find me useful. - Using cors

8. I am a form on one of the EJS pages. When I send data, the backend always misses one. Silly spelling Error - Fixed typo : image: req.body.images -> image: req.body.image

9. I am Update and Delete operation of this project. Even though am working perfectly, am not being implemented with the proper method.

10. I am a deprecated method that welcomes a new user in this project. You know better now. - Using alert npm package

### Part #3 Deployment in Heroku
